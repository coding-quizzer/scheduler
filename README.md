# Interview Scheduler

Interview Scheduler is a RESTful client-side web application that allows users to schedule interviews given a day, intervewer and student name. The data is stored on a server, so the client can exit or reload the app without losing information.

## Setup

Install dependencies with `npm install`.

## Starting the app

Run npm install with the server running to start the app. The app will open automatically in your browser.
