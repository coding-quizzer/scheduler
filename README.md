# Interview Scheduler

Fork and clone scheduler API from https://github.com/lighthouse-labs/scheduler-api. Follow the instructions in the README to set up the database 

## Starting the app
Start up scheduler-api using npm start to start the server in normal mode. (Run npm run error to start the server in error mode)

Run npm start with the server running to start the app. The app will open automatically in your browser.

## Testing
Run npm test to run jest tests.

Run npm run storybook to open the storybook.
