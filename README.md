# Interview Scheduler

Interview Scheduler is a RESTful client-side web application that allows users to schedule interviews given a day, intervewer and student name. The data is stored on a server, so the client can exit or reload the app without losing information.

## Setup

Install dependencies with `npm install`.

## Starting the app
Fork and clone scheduler API from https://github.com/lighthouse-labs/scheduler-api. Follow the instructions in the README to set up the database and npm start to start the server in normal mode. (npm test error for error mode)

Run npm install with the server running to start the app. The app will open automatically in your browser.

## Testing
Run npm test to run jest tests.

Run npm run storybook to open the storybook. 

Run npm run cypress to open cypress.
